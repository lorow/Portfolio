                <span>Alright, now that we've got all of this out of the way, let me tell you something about me.</span>

                <span>I'm a Python backend developer with 3 years of "commercial experience" on my back.
                I love working on side projects in my free time, they are "excuses" for me to get out of my comfort zone and try something new. 
                Be it a new language, new tech, a completely different field, I will learn something.</span>

                <span>But it's not just work that makes us tick.</span>
                <span>I also love riding around the city on my trusty EUC, listenting to the harder styles of music and exploring and taking pictures of beautiful worlds inside of VRChat.</span>
                <span>I find it quite amazing to be able to explore something shy of pure creators imagination, to see and experience what they imaigned in so many more ways is, I think, beautiful.</span>
                <span>I don't have them posted anywhere yet tho.</span>

                <span>Anyway, sorry for the rambling, and thanks for visiting!.</span>
