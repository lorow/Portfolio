                <span>So, Hi! I'm Zdzis≈Çaw, and I'm a passionate backend developer who is always tinkering with something</span> 
                <span>Be it new langauge, new framework, new field, new tech. Doesn't matter, if I find it interesting I will find a way to try it out</span>

                <span>But it's not just work that makes us tick</span>
                <span>
                    I've recently picked up a hobby of taking pictures of the worlds I explore in VR in VRChat, though I don't have them posted anywhere yet.
                    I find it quite amazing to be able to explore something shy of pure creators imagination, to see and experience what they imagined in so many more ways is something beautiful.
                    Besides that, I really love riding on an EUC. I love that feeling of flying through the city, zipping past everything, my electric unicycle gives me, it just feels so surreal.
                </span>

                <span>Anyway, sorry for the rambling, and thanks for visiting!</span>
